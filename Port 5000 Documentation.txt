<====! Version 1.3 changelog 11/7/2017!=====>
  =First live, unique update to port 5000=

	-Finally! You can press the enter button to send messages, hooray!
	-div#chat-window { background-color:#f3f3f3;} // easier see, i guess?
	-Added meta viewport for easy mobile compatibility (surprisingly, my padding & margins already made it mobile compatible!)
	-Added font-family to body for a sexier GUI and text formatting. 
	

	How pressing the enter button works:
	
	1. attach an event listener 'change' to the message input
	2. (built into js) if you press, enter - it will exceute a function (if u attached a function to addEventListener)
	3. It emits chat message data to all sockets through this callback function
	4. I am so happy right now, here is a virtual hug.

	CODE:
	// IN THE div#message , pressing enter will emit the chat to all sockets
	//oh my god i took an entire week to figure this OUT YAYAYYYYYY MY GOD YESSSSSSSSSS 
	
	message.addEventListener("change", function(){
 	     socket.emit('chatmsg',{ // chatmsg first initiation
   		message: message.value, // get value of message input field
   	        handle: handle.value
  		});
	});
