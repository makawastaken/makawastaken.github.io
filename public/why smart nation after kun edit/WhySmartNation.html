		<h2>Why?</h2>
		The number of elderly citizens is expected to triple to 900,000 by 2030, and with a declining old-age support ratio with our low birth rates, it is imperative that healthcare is made more proactive to guide people to take pre-emptive steps to keep themselves healthy or better manage their well-being. Here are some ways technology can help deliver holistic Healthcare and Eldercare to aid active ageing.

		living, create more opportunities, and support stronger communities by harnessing 
		info-comm technologies, networks and big data. Through strategic deployment of 
		technology across the nation, leveraging on investments in digital infrastructure, 
		a tech savvy population and a single layer government that can work quickly to 
		coordinate policies and synergise efforts, the Smart Nation initiative strives

        SOME fear that the less tech-savvy, will get left behind. This is why building a smart nation "should not be just about adopting new and 'cool' technologies", but about meeting the unique needs of people. Like a good highway, the value of connectivity to a smart nation is not about the speed that can be achieved, but the destinations it serves and the services along its path that benefit its users.
		For example, there could be boards with text that can be updated, or speakers that can play a message in different languages, at void decks.

	More than 1,000 sensors that measure levels of humidity, light, noise, sulphur dioxide, haze particles in the air and temperature will be installed in the town. They will be used to monitor and control traffic lights or detect illegal smoking, among other things. 
	A new satellite-based electronic road pricing system (ERP2) in the works could charge a motorist based on how far he travels on congested roads, and can track the precise position of each car. The data will be anonymous, however, and aggregated with that of many others who move in a similar pattern. 
	Future homes can come equipped with energy sensors that monitor how much energy each appliance consumes. This information can make it easier for residents to reduce their overall energy usage.
	Motion sensors can track the movements of senior citizens at home, and alert caregivers if the seniors exhibit irregular movements, for instance, if they fall or faint.

    Though technology is always pervasive in nature, the educational think-tank of Singapore has been able to 
	take away the best and slam what could affect students and the entire education system. Eliminating the need 
	of technology as a dominating tool, they have shown keen interest in just studying the manner in which technology 
	transforms learning.The key has been to bring learning to its highest possible level for the learners through 
	the best exercise of technology, regardless of which stream of study they come from. This is the aspect where 
	Singapore outdoes its nearest rivals in the area of education. The country aims not only at modernizing its 
	traditional education methods, but also ensures that the use of technology is made student-oriented. Veteran 
	educationists strictly believe that learning to exploit modern technology in a learner-centered manner is 
	probably the biggest challenge that can ever show up in the process of making an education system completely 
	hi-tech to lead the world.Besides having almost all digital tools for learning, Singapore education system
	prefers improved standards of learning to having more modern teaching aids and excessive information. Being 
	a small country, Singapore makes huge investments to implement modern technology in schools and this has so 
	far shown amazing results.

    With a population of 5.4 million and land area of 718 square kilometres, 94 percent of Singapore’s population 
	live in high-rise apartments, of which, 82 percent dwell in public housing.1 As an ultra-dense city-state, 
	effective and innovative urban development is a social and economic imperative intricately intertwined with 
	Singapore’s competitiveness and quality of life. Harnessing information and communications technology (ICT) 
	is not only essential to achieving this, but also serves as a template for answering some of the global 
	challenges faced by urban centres around the world–particularly in regard to economic development, social 
	cohesion, better city administration and infrastructure management. Governments around the world are 
	recognising the opportunities and benefits associated with smart city initiatives as a means to address 
	denser, more diverse and growing urban populations. Singapore is unique in that it has been engaged in 
	what could be considered ‘smart city initiatives’ since the 1980s. Its smart nation model places people 
	at the centre of four enablers: governance, manpower, partnerships and technology. Lessons from Singapore’s 
	experience in national ICT planning, as well as its current endeavours to create a smart nation, may serve 
	as important guidelines for urban policymakers and practitioners in countries and cities around the world.

       Several new initiatives including self-driving vehicles, satellite-linked 
devices for dynamic road tolls and public car park chaging and pneumatic waste conveyance 
system for HDB flats have been announced. One major initiative will be to let people access maps and build up geospatial databases by 
contributing information such as animal sightings, traffic incidents or the best eateries.
Imagine commuter transport synchronised to your personal needs, roads of driverless cars, 
robot-run restaurants, and even sensors that alert public officers that someone is smoking 
where they should not. Someday Singaporeans could control their appliances from their phones, switching them off 
and on remotely, they could also call for a self-driving car, and use a watch to pay for 
items.

    The first national IT plan was formulated in 1980. Since then, six master plans have been executed 
	to bring Singapore closer to achieving its vision of becoming an ‘intelligent island’. The 1980 
	inaugural infocomm master plan focused largely on a national computerisation programme for government 
	agencies. Subsequent programmes concentrated on extending computerisation and connectivity to 
	the private sector, while also connecting people–and the island itself–to the broader world. 
	These programmes brought significant economic benefits and gains in the efficiency of service 
	delivery. In 2015, the government announced the ‘Smart Nation Initiative’ with an aim to see 
	Singapore become the world’s first smart nation by 2025, and also further enhance networked 
	computerisation capabilities in order to remain globally competitive. Singapore’s notion of 
	a smart nation is based on its ability to gather data, interpret it, glean insights and then 
	translate those insights into meaningful action. The Smart Nation Platform (SNP), spearheaded
	by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), Singapore’s ICT development agency and regulator, 
	is thus built around three focus areas: Connect, Collect, and Comprehend. It will further 
	enhance Singapore’s capabilities in pervasive connectivity by building new 
	and scalable infrastructure along with common technical architecture to support a smart 
	nation ecosystem. The plan includes developing a Smart Nation Operating System (SN-OS), 
	which can be thought of as being equivalent to a computer operating system. It seeks to 
	connect sub-systems of the nation to facilitate the creation of an integrated common picture 
	for better situational awareness. For example, given Singapore’s growing ageing population,
	SN-OS aims to implement user-friendly sensors in the homes of the elderly. Caregivers and 
	healthcare providers can then monitor the aged and respond better, given the advanced knowledge 
	captured by the system.

    Singapore developed its IT capabilities over several decades through strategic investments in computing 
	infrastructure. Such capabilities include an extensive and continuously developed IT infrastructure, 
	competencies in identifying and and providing efficient integrated electronic services, and continued 
	investment in developing the IT capabilities of both service providers and users throughout Singapore. 
	On IT infrastructure, the World Economic Forum ranks Singapore as one of the most network-ready countries 
	in the world. The IT infrastructure and networks would have been inconsequential without the skills to 
	quickly build and apply IT solutions. The foundation for ‘soft infrastructure’ or IT manpower was firmly 
	established in the earlier ICT Masterplans. Literacy, including a high emphasis on computer-based skills
	education, helps prepare students for the digital economy and future employment. Accompanying the involvement 
	of the community groups and schools, significant investments were also made to support specific adoption
	programmes among low-income households and late adopters of ICT.

    Our economy and local workforce are going through major transition, from higher quantity growth to lower 
	but better quality growth. Our aim is to create better jobs and careers to meet the higher aspirations 
	of our people who are and will continue to be better educated and better skilled. The Infocomm Technology sector, 
	ICT for short, is a good illustration. Technology is fast changing, and offers endless opportunities for us to
	exploit as a smart nation, and export as a leading ICT hub. There are currently more than 8,500 job vacancies 
	posted in the Jobs Bank. With the rapid emergence of digital economy and our vision of Smart Nation, we will 
	see exciting growth in jobs and career options in ICT for years to come. From software development, to cyber 
	security, data analytics, and network and infrastructure support. To better connect the growing scope of ICT 
	career opportunities with the diverse interest of ICT jobseekers, we need to overcome two challenges – missed 
	match and mismatch. First, the challenge of missed match.
	The faster the pace of change in ICT technology, infrastructure, innovation and application, the more difficult
	it will be for jobseekers to keep track of where and how to pursue what could be suitable for them. 
	As a result, the jobs are there, the jobseekers are there, but the two may keep missing each other 
	like two ships passing by each other in the dark.
	We need to reduce such missed match.
	Second, the challenge of mismatch. 
	Even if the jobseekers know what ICT jobs they want, they may not have the skills, expertise and experience 
	needed by the employers. This applies to not just newcomers to the ICT sector, but also those with some years
	of ICT experience. Because of the fast pace of technological change, many need to re-learn so as to remain or
	re-enter the ICT sector.
	To overcome this twin challenges of missed match and mismatch, the tripartite partners in ICT have come together 
	to launch probably the most comprehensive and coordinated career support system we have put together, to-date.
	These initiatives are driven by the ICT sector and professional body (SCS), supported by the union (NTUC, e2i),
	and facilitated by the government agencies (IMDA, WSG, SSG).
	The first initiative is Integrated Career Services for TechSkills Accelerator, TeSA ICS for short.
	The TeSA ICS is a support network to help update ICT professionals and jobseekers on the availability 
	of jobs and careers, and the types of training and knowledge needed to stay relevant in the industry.   
	With the ICS, individuals can now access the full suite of career assistance and resources, when they 
	visit any career centre at WSG, e2i, or U PME for career support, as well as when they seek career mentoring at SCS.
	The second initiative is the SkillsFuture Career Advisors for ICT. Currently, e2i and Career Centres of
	Workforce Singapore do provide broad-based career guidance to jobseekers.
	But increasingly, we see the need to provide more in-depth career advice targeted at specific sectors.
	This is due to faster pace of change and growing scope for intra-sector specialisation and conversion.
	We are kicking off this SkillsFuture Career Advisors Programme, a new programme under the Adapt and Grow initiative.

			Advances in digital technology have opened up new possibilities to enhance the
	way we live, work, play, and interact. Singapore strives to become a Smart Nation 
	to support better living, stronger communities, and create more opportunities, for all.
	And “smartness” is not a measure of how advanced or complex the technology being adopted 
	is, but how well a society uses technology to solve its problems and address existential 
	challenges. Citizens are ultimately at the heart of our Smart Nation vision, not technology!
